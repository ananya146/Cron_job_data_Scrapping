    "description": "These magical adaptations became instant classics when they were first broadcast on BBC Radio 4, and continue to delight today. Tolkien's epic tale of Middle-earth has all the classic ingredients of fantasy and adventure: dwarves, elves, goblins and trolls, a terrifying dragon, a great wizard, a fearsome evil, a perilous quest and a dramatic climax. With an all-star cast including Ian Holm, Michael Hordern, Robert Stephens, John le Mesurier and Bill Nighy, these enchanting dramatisations are a must for all Tolkien fans. 'For those who find the books too long-winded and the films too noisy, this is the perfect way to assimilate the myth and magic of Middle-earth' - Guardian.19 CDs. 17 hrs 30 mins.",
